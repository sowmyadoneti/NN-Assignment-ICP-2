Neural Network Assignment ICP_2 Programs In this assignment, the below concepts are covered:

string concatenation, list slicing, input_and_output file read and write concepts, nested Interactive loop, list comprehensions

1. Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to
fullname function that should return the (full name).
 o For example:
▪ First_name = “your first name”, last_name = “your last name”
▪ Full_name = “your full name”
 o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string.
Str = “Good evening”
Output: Go vnn
Note: You need to create a function named “string_alternative” for this program and call it from
main function.

2. Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output.
o Finally store the output in output.txt file.
Example:

    Input: a file includes two lines:
Python Course
Deep Learning Course

     Output:
Python Course
Deep Learning Course
Word_Count:
Python: 1
Course: 2
Deep: 1
Learning: 1

3. Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these
heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
1) Nested Interactive loop.
2) List comprehensions
Example: L1: [150,155, 145, 148]
Output: [68.03, 70.3, 65.77, 67.13]
